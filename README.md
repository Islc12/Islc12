# Welcome to My GitHub

I'm **Rich aka Islc12** — a U.S. Marine Corps veteran turned System Administrator, passionate about network security, low-level systems programming, and building practical tools for red teams.

I started my journey earning my first degree in **Cybersecurity (AAS)**, now pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science**. I'm working towards a specialization in security-oriented software development, with interest in embedded devices and systems, using **Python**, **Java** & **C**. Professionally, I'm a **System Administrator** for a public sector IT department, where I automate system tasks and maintain both Linux and Windows infrastructure.

## Featured Projects

### [OkeusStrike](https://github.com/Islc12/OkeusStrike)
**802.11 Deauthentication Attack Tool (Python)**

A precision-crafted wireless DoS attack tool designed for security testing. Built using raw sockets completely within the Python Standard Library, OkeusStrike gives users full control over deauthentication frames. This includes having a framework that allows for building frames entirely from scratch, allowing complete control for Security Research purposes. A future version will be rewritten in C for performance.

> Focus: Offensive Security | WiFi Attacks | Protocol Framing | Scapy | Raw Sockets  
> Status: Active Development (Python) → Rewrite (C)

### [WTop](https://github.com/Islc12/WTop)
**Terminal-based Network Process Viewer**

Inspired by the classic `top` utility, WTop is a real-time terminal interface that displays per-process CPU, Memory & NPM usage. Written as a PowerShell script, WTop can be a useful tool for remote systems monitoring for system administrators using minimal system resources itself compared to conventional RMM software.

> Focus: Resource Monitoring | Remote System Administration | TUI Interfaces  
> Status: Initial Development
